# GDZIE MOJE SKRZYPCE?!

The website for musicians, bands and people who try to find them. As a musician you create your profile with photos and sample of your music, tag yourself and wait for contact from potential customer. You can also check other musicians on the platform and decide to start cooperating with them. As a user you can see musicians profiles and find the one suits you. You can filter by available tags (such as 'weeding' or 'jazz') or any words you can think of when dreaming of your perfect band.

The website is in development and testing mode. Currently available features:
- register and login
- visible list with bands and musicians
- creating and updating multiple bands profiles with name, images, tags and description
